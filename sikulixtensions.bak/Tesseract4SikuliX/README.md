Tesseract4SikuliX 2014 (version 1.1.x)
===

This is an adaption of the work [Tess4J](http://tess4j.sourceforge.net) to the needs of this project, to allow the use of relevant Tesseract features directly from the Java level. The implementation is on level Tesseract 3.02 and uses JNA direct mapping to access the native functions in the library libtesseract.

For Windows and Mac the native packages will again be pre-built and ready-to-use. For Linux there will be advices and scripts available to get the needed needed libraries ready.
