nm -D /usr/lib64/libJXGrabKey.so
nm -o /usr/lib64/lib*.a 2>/dev/null | grep  XOpenDisplay | grep -w T

What this does is
    Ask for the symbols in all of the libraries in /usr/lib. (On a 64-bit system you may need to check /usr/lib64.) The -o option prints not only the symbol but also the name of the file it comes from.
    Grab the symbol you care about: XOpenDisplay.
    Grep for definitions of that symbol in the text section—the lone T is how nm(1) signals a definition in the text section. I might have also tried grep -w [TD] to get text or data.
